## Description

This is a small app built in react that allows you to interact with a museum search api. It is a fully responsive modern UI that allows you to search and view a museum art collection. It uses a state machine (x-state) to manage it's state. It uses a combination of libraries to handle async requests and promise debouncing (awesome-debounce-promise, react-async-hook, etc).
